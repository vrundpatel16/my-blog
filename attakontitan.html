                <p>
  Levi Ackerman is the embodiment of discipline and lethality. Raised in the underground and hardened by loss, he rose to become humanity’s most formidable warrior. With unmatched agility and ruthless efficiency, Levi has slain more Titans than any other soldier. Yet beneath his cold demeanor lies a deep sense of loyalty and justice. Whether facing Titans or traitors, Levi fights not for glory—but for the lives that still remain.
