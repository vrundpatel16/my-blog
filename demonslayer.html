                <h3>Tanjiro Kamodo</h3>
                 <p>A gentle soul forged in tragedy, Tanjiro Kamado rises as a demon slayer with unmatched empathy and unwavering resolve. Wielding the power of Water Breathing and later the legendary Sun Breathing, he fights not just to avenge his family—but to restore his sister Nezuko’s humanity and honor the pain of those lost to darkness.

                <h3>Nezuko Kamado – Flame Within Silence</h3>
                <p> Once a gentle human girl, Nezuko Kamado was transformed into a demon—but defied her nature to protect the brother she loves. Silent yet fierce, she fights with Combustible Blood and unshakable will, embodying the paradox of innocence and power. Her journey is one of quiet rebellion, emotional depth, and the hope that even in darkness, humanity can endure.</p>

                <h3>Inosuke Hashibira – Beast of the Blade</h3>
                <p>
  Raised by boars and driven by instinct, Inosuke Hashibira charges into battle with raw power and reckless courage. Wielding dual serrated swords and his self-taught Beast Breathing style, he’s unpredictable, untamed, and fiercely loyal. Beneath the boar mask lies a surprisingly delicate face—and a heart learning what it means to trust, feel, and belong.

                <h3>Zenitsu Agatsuma – Thunder Beneath Fear</h3>
                <p>
  Timid, loud, and often panicked, Zenitsu Agatsuma hides a storm within. Though he trembles in the face of danger, his mastery of Thunder Breathing unleashes lightning-fast strikes when unconscious—turning fear into ferocity. Beneath his cowardice lies a loyal heart, a sharp ear, and a burning desire to prove he’s more than his doubts.

                <h3>Muzan Kibutsuji – Demon King Eternal</h3>
                <p>
  A thousand years of darkness, and Muzan Kibutsuji still fears only one thing: death. The first demon, born from a failed cure, he commands the Twelve Kizuki with ruthless precision and manipulates fate itself to pursue immortality. Elegant yet monstrous, he shifts forms and identities with ease—masking cruelty beneath charm. His obsession with permanence drives him to seek the Blue Spider Lily and create a demon immune to sunlight. To Muzan, change is weakness. Eternity is perfection.
